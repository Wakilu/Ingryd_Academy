## What is Variable? 
Variables are a fundamental concept in both programming and mathematics, allowing for the representation and manipulation of data.

-A variable is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a storage location in a computer's memory.

-It is used to store and manipulate data within a program.

-Variables can hold different types of data, including numbers, text, and more complex structures like   arrays or objects.

-The value stored in a variable can change during the execution of a program, which is why it's called a "variable."

## Data Type

A data type is a classification or category that specifies which kind of data an object can hold. Data types are essential for performing various operations on variables and values in a program.

Data types in Python are important because they determine how data can be stored, manipulated, and used in your programs. Understanding data types is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code, as it helps you ensure that the operations you perform on your data are appropriate for the type of data you are working with. Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; it's inferred based on the value assigned to it.


### Numeric Data Types:
int: This data type represents integers, which are whole numbers with no decimal point.
float: It is used to represent floating-point numbers, which have decimal points or use scientific notation.
complex: Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts can be represented using this data type.

### Sequence Data Types:
str: A string is a sequence of characters, such as text. It's enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.
list: Lists are ordered and mutable collections of items. They can hold a variety of data types..
tuple: Similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.

### Mapping Data Type:
dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is used to store data as key-value associations.

### Set Data Types:
set: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is used for operations like union, intersection, and difference.

frozenset: Similar to a set, but it is immutable.

### Boolean Data Type:
bool: Represents Boolean values, which can be either True or False.

### None Type:
None: A special data type representing the absence of a value or a null value.

### Binary Data Types:
bytes: Represents a sequence of bytes, suitable for storing binary data.
bytearray: Similar to bytes but mutable.
